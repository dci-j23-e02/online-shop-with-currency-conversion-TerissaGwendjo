### Assignment: Building an Online Shop with Currency Conversion

#### Objective:
In this assignment, you will build an online shop application using Java Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf. The application will allow users to sign up, log in, browse products, add products to their cart, and convert prices between different currencies using the ExchangeRate API.

#### Requirements:
1. **User Management**:
   - Users should be able to sign up and log in.
   - Users should have roles (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`).
   - Admins should be able to assign the `ROLE_ADMIN` to other users.

2. **Product Management**:
   - Admins should be able to add, update, and delete products.
   - Users should be able to view products and add them to their cart.

3. **Currency Conversion**:
   - Users should be able to convert product prices between different currencies using the ExchangeRate API.

4. **Security**:
   - Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
   - Passwords should be securely stored using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.

5. **Database**:
   - Use JPA and Hibernate to manage entities and relationships.

   - Use repositories to perform CRUD operations.

4. **Thymeleaf**:
   - Create dynamic HTML templates.
   - Use Thymeleaf expressions to populate content.

5. **Controllers**:
   - Implement controllers to handle HTTP requests and return views.
   - Handle form submissions.

6. **Service Layer**:
   - Implement business logic in the service layer.
   - Interact with repositories to perform database operations.

7. **RESTful API Integration**:
   - Use `RestTemplate` to make HTTP requests to the ExchangeRate API.

8. **Bidirectional Relationships**:
   - Implement bidirectional relationships between entities.

9. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement basic error handling.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Set Up the Project
1. Create a new Spring Boot project with the following dependencies:
   - Spring Web
   - Spring Security
   - Spring Data JPA
   - PostgreSQL Driver
   - Thymeleaf
   - Spring Boot DevTools

2. Configure the `application.properties` file with the necessary settings:
   ```properties
   # Server Configuration
   server.port=8080

   # Database Configuration
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/onlineshop
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

   # JPA/Hibernate properties
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

   # Email Configuration
   spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
   spring.mail.port=587
   spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com
   spring.mail.password=your_email_password
   spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
   spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true

   # ExchangeRate-API Key
   exchangerate.api.key=your_api_key
   ```

#### Step 2: Implement User Management
1. **Entities**:
   - Create `User` and `Role` entities with a many-to-many relationship.
   - Create `VerificationToken` entity for email verification.

2. **Repositories**:
   - Create `UserRepository`, `RoleRepository`, and `VerificationTokenRepository`.

3. **Services**:
   - Implement `UserService` to handle user-related operations.
   - Implement email verification logic.

4. **Controllers**:
   - Implement `UserController` to handle user-related requests (signup, login, assign admin role, verify email).

5. **Security Configuration**:
   - Implement `SecurityConfig` to configure authentication and authorization.

#### Step 3: Implement Product Management
1. **Entities**:
   - Create `Product` entity with fields like `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `currency`.

2. **Repositories**:
   - Create `ProductRepository`.

3. **Services**:
   - Implement `ProductService` to handle product-related operations.

4. **Controllers**:
   - Implement `ProductController` to handle product-related requests (add, update, delete, view products).

#### Step 4: Implement Currency Conversion
1. **Service**:
   - Implement `CurrencyConverterService` to interact with the ExchangeRate API.

2. **Controller**:
   - Implement `CurrencyConverterController` to handle currency conversion requests.

3. **Templates**:
   - Create `currency-converter.html` to allow users to convert product prices between different currencies.

#### Step 5: Implement User Interface
1. **Templates**:
   - Create `login.html`, `signup.html`, `home.html`, `admin-home.html`, `product-list.html`, `product-form.html`, and `currency-converter.html` using Thymeleaf.

2. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Use Thymeleaf expressions to dynamically populate content in the templates.

#### Step 6: Test the Application
1. **Sign Up and Log In**:
   - Test user signup and login functionality.
   - Verify email and assign admin role.

2. **Product Management**:
   - Test adding, updating, deleting, and viewing products.

3. **Currency Conversion**:
   - Test converting product prices between different currencies.

4. **Security**:
   - Test role-based access control.

### Submission:
Submit the following:
1. Source code of the project.
2. A README file with instructions on how to run the application.
3. Screenshots or a video demonstrating the functionality of the application.

### Concepts Explained:

1. **Spring Boot**:
   - Spring Boot simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications by providing default configurations and embedded servers. It allows you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.

2. **Spring Security**:
   - Spring Security provides authentication and authorization capabilities. It allows you to secure your application by implementing role-based access control and password encoding.

3. **JPA and Hibernate**:
   - JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java. Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. They allow you to map Java objects to database tables and perform CRUD operations.

4. **Thymeleaf**:
   - Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments. It allows you to create dynamic HTML templates and populate them with data from your application.

5. **Controllers**:
   - Controllers handle HTTP requests, interact with the service layer, and return views. They follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

6. **Service Layer**:
   - The service layer contains business logic and interacts with repositories to perform database operations. It encapsulates the core functionality of the application.

7. **RESTful API Integration**:
   - RESTful APIs allow you to interact with external services. In this assignment, you will use the ExchangeRate API to fetch conversion rates and supported currencies.

8. **Bidirectional Relationships**:
   - Bidirectional relationships between entities allow you to navigate the relationship from both sides. For example, a `User` can have multiple `Roles`, and a `Role` can have multiple `Users`.

9. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling ensures that your application can gracefully handle unexpected situations. It includes throwing exceptions and providing meaningful error messages to the user.

By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience with these concepts and learn how to build a secure, user-friendly online shop application with currency conversion capabilities.
